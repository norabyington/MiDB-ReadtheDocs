# *The Minnsota Supercomputing Institute (MSI) provides the software, hardware, storage and experts to support research projects in all reserach areas.*

## **Registering for Access**

### *UMN Employees*

[Request an MSI account](https://www.msi.umn.edu/access) and your account can be created from your UMN InternetID (formerly called x500).

### *Non-UMN Employees*

In order to request an MSI account as a non-UMN employee, a Person of Interest (POI) account must first be created. The requestor needs written approval from Dr. Damien Fair or another DCAN Leadership team member. Send written approval to Nora Byington (bying015@umn.edu) to initiate the POI account creation process.

## **Gaining Access**

1. To remotely log into MSI you need to establish a VPN connection. Detailed instructions can be found on [HST/AHC: VPN and Remote Desktop Setup](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/how-tos/hstahc-vpn-remote-desktop-setup).

2. Structure of High Performance Computer (HPC) Systems  

- To learn more about the structure of the HPC system, visit the [MSI website](https://www.msi.umn.edu/tutorials) for a list of tutorials.  
- **Launch a Terminal** - To Launch a terminal, visit [NX](https://nx.msi.umn.edu/nxwebplayer) or [NICE](https://nice.msi.umn.edu/enginframe/vdi/vdi.xml?_uri=//com.enginframe.interactive/list.sessions) and login with your UMN credentials.  
- **Enter Mesabi Node** - To access files and request resources for a job, you must log into the Mesabi Node.  

    ssh -Y mesabi

    You will then be prompted to enter your UMN password again.

    All jobs executed on the Mesabi node will terminate after 15 minutes. If your task requires more time, select one of the following options:  

  - *Compute Node*  

    - Requesting resources:  srun -N 1 --ntasks-per-node=4  --mem-per-cpu=1gb -t 1:00:00 -p interactive --x11 --pty bash  
    *update time and memory as needed*

    - Usage guidelines: Use this for all jobs that don't meet the requirements of the DCAN node.

  - *DCAN Node*  

    - Requesting resources:  srun -N 1 --cpus-per-task=4 --mem-per-cpu=4gb -t 4:00:00 --x11 -p dcan --pty bash

    - Usage guidelines:  This node is reserved for high priority/high RAM/CPU power demands. Email the listserv before running a job.

        Note: The DCAN Node has restricted access. Please contact Nora       Byington (bying015@umn.edu) if a PI has instructed you to gain access.
