# DCAN Code and Data Locations at UMN

## Code

Code will be saved the the msi in a central location where everyone can access it

**Location**: /panfs/roc/groups/8/faird/shared/code  
        - *Location shortcut*: /home/faird/shared/code

**Folder organization**: The folder “code” will have two directories: internal and external. Each directory will have subdirectories for different types of code (analyses, utilities, etc). Repos (example FRF, fconn anova) will live in each folder. See example below taken from rushmore at ohsu
Current folder structure via tree command:

Each repo must be kept under version control and has a developer responsible.  
Stewardship is defined in the following table:  
[INSERT TABLE]  
Steward is responsible for keeping the code updated and making sure folder permissions are not chaged after updating code.  

## Data

To optimize computing resources the MSI offers two types of [storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/storage-allocations): [High Performance Storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/high-performance-storage) and [Second Tier Storage](https://www.msi.umn.edu/content/second-tier-storage). Data in the High Performance Storage is backed up and is accessible from all MSI system. Big data is stored in the Second Tier. Data for each particular project can be found on each PI’s space, depending on who leads each particular project. This table (make a md table describing ) summarizes the existing datasets in the DCAN.

DCAN’s High Performance Storage data is located here:

- **/panfs/roc/groups/8/faird/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/miran045/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/feczk001/shared/data**  
- **/panfs/roc/groups/4/rando149/shared/data**  

DCAN’s storage can also be accessed from MSI using the following shortcuts:

- **/home/faird/shared/data**  
- **/home/miran045/shared/data**  
- **/home/feczk001/shared/data**  
- **/home/rando149/shared/data**  

Below is the current structure for shared data on each server:

Our group has access to 480 TB of Second Tier Storage.  
Requests to save data on primary or secondary storage must be submitted to DCAN leadership. Here are the links to move data across locations:  

- Protocol to move data between a) High Performance Storage and b) Second Tier Storage.  
- Protocol to move data between a) external institutions and b) High Performance Storage data.  
- Protocol to move data between a) external institutions and b) Second Tier Storage.
