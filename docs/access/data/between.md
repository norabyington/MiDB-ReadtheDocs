# Data Transfers Between Institutions

In general, most data and files can be transferred between OHSU and UMN institutions. HOWEVER, there are two categories of files/data that have transfer restrictions, for different reasons:

1. **Identifiable data such as DICOMs, participant names, addresses, should not be transferred via services without a business use agreement (BUA)**: In particular, DICOM data, names, addresses, anything that has been shown to identify an individual cannot be transferred using services without a BUA. When wanting to transfer such data between institutions, please discuss with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that appropriate measures are taken for security.

2. **Software programs** usually cannot be transferred and must be installed. For internal libraries maintained on github, gitlab, or docker, users should clone the libraries to the proper code location

## Box

Box is a secure storage that is HIPPA compliant and available across many institutions. UMNâ€™s IT maintains a [set of guides](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/self-help-guides/box-secure-storage-work-files-folders) to learn how to access Box, manage the storage, and transfer data.

## Globus

Globus is a file transfer service that has encrypted services for transmitting large-scale data between institutions. Visit UMN's [starting guide](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-globus-transfer-data-msi-0) for information on setting up Globus for transferring data to and from MSI servers.
